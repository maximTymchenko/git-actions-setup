              Nevertheless, security is not a one time job, itâ€™s a continuous

              assets, and to contain top operational security years around.

              programs. We involve **ORGANIZATION X** to regularly skill them
              up. People who work with your intellectual property must know how
              to protect it.

              For instance, according to one of our information security
              policies (10 policies in total) all our employees and
              subcontractors are obligated to use full-disk encryption
              solutions. The vast majority of our employees are using OS native
              solutions as Microsoft BitLocker and Apple FileVault. All the
              Recovery keys and passwords are under the control of our internal
              security team. Plus, a centralized device management solution
              allows us remotely delete any information on a employees laptops.
              As a result, a lost laptop will never be a threat to your
              intellectual property.
